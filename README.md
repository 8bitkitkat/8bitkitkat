# Hi

I'm Ketan Reynolds

I'm proficient in the languages Rust, C/C++, C#, Java and Kotlin. <br/>
I'm also skilled with Windows, MacOS, and Linux (Desktop and Server)

Iâ€™m currently working on [Zinc](https://github.com/zinc-lang/zinc).
You can learn more about it below.

## Mission

### What?

- Programming language (Zinc)
- Generic GUI library(s) - Written in zinc (Copper)
- File editor (Fe)
- Non-textual programming language - Much like [Dion](https://dion.systems) (currently referred to as NTPL)

### Zinc (Programming language)

With this, I aim to provide a programming language that rivals C++ in performance and flexibility, while providing a developer experience close to that of rust.

### Copper (GUI Library(s))

This is still largely undecided. The direction of this largely depends on what happens with zinc.
It is also largely undecided if this will be a retained or immediate mode architecture, or both, hence the (s).

The goal for this is to be a jumping off point for Fe. It should also be designed with runtime extensibility in mind.
For plugins of Fe. As will be later mention, the NTPL should be implemented as an extension to Fe, providing its own editor and UI.

### Fe (File editor)

The goal of this is to be a slim fast and extensible file, plan text, code editor and anything that someone can make into an extension editor.
To be make in Zinc with Copper.
To be fully extensible - any and all APIs available to extensions. All functionality, unless required to be a part of the core, should be an extension.
To be a competitor to VScode.

The NTPL will be an extension, providing its own UI, APIs and any other needed functionality.

### NTPL (Non-textual programming language)

The same vision as [Dion](https://dion.systems).
With this we wish to go our own direction with research, I would not call us a competitor, but no less competition breeds innovation.

Half of the problem to solve here will be solved by Fe, this is just the extra tooling and compiler for a programming language built on top of Fe.

It should be stated that this does not have the goal of being exclusive to Fe, Fe will be the editor we choose to built the NTPL's editor on top of.
The file format and compiler will not be 

One possible, but yet to be explored possibility, would be to have a library with which the file format is queried and edited with, of which the Fe extension will only be a front-end to.
