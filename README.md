# Hello there

I'm Ketan.

Iâ€™m currently working on [Zinc](https://github.com/zinc-lang/zinc).
You can learn more about it in its repo.

I mostly code in rust, zig and c/c++(begrudgingly),
but I still end up using languages like c#, typescript, java and kotlin often enough.
As long as imperative and not a lisp, I can program in it.

I mostly focus on what could be called the user/developer experience, that's making it run fast and efficiently, making it ergonomic and making it easy to understand while maximizing user control and not oversimplifying.
